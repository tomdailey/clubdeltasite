<h1>Tom Dailey</h1>
	<p>I tutor kids who are interested in or need help with math, programming, playing the piano, writing, or reading. I'm also interested in finding ways to use an open-source minefcraft clone, <a href="http://minetest.net">Minetest</a>, to motivate and provide an envirnoment to practice algebra and geometry.</p>
	<p>To contact me for a lesson, email me at tom@theclubdelta.com.</p>
	<h4>My Schedule</h4>
	<p>I prefer to tutor in 45-55 minute increments, weekdays between 1 and 5. If you have any other preferences I'd be happy to accomodate.</p>
