		<h2>Lessons</h2>
		<p></p>
		<p>The curriculla used in schools is often a list of skills or facts that the teacher is responsible for imbuing in their students. This means that from the start, lessons are contrived to satisfy artificial outcomes, instead of building on and deepening the interests, perspectives, and understanding that every student already has.</p>
		<p>We'll interface with our student's teachers to allign our sessions with content that will improve student performance. While we understand the importance of following the curriculla, we recognize that current common core learning can prove unengaging and uninteresting to young minds. We believe that truly optimizing performance requires unique departures and tangents for each student.</p>
		<p>We don't have a curriculla we force upon students, we have knowledge and experience for the student to put to work. They share with us their interests and ambitions, and we research the underlying domain to foster their creative capabilities.</p>
		<p>We are consultants, mentors, shirpas, and companions, not managers, pedagogues or drill sargeants.</p>
