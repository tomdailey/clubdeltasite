		<h2>An education and creation community for Binghamton</h2>
		<p>At Club Delta, we're starting something new.</p>
		<p>The education system has grown out of years of overlapping norms and policies that have made it clunky and ineffective for many students. Often times, memorization leads to better grades, discouraging them from deeply engaging with and understanding the material. We believe that project based learning and enthusiastic instructors can make a lasting educational experience that cultivates the interests of the student.</p>
		<p>COVID has changed things. Teachers are forced to work beyond their bounds, and parents are spread thin trying to teach things they haven't learned, don't remember, or haven't used in years. Now more than ever, students need access to people who have the time and resources to help them succeed.</p>
